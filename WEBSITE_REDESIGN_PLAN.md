# Britannia Coaches Website Redesign Plan
## Industry Research Analysis & Complete Website Architecture

### Executive Summary
Based on research of award-winning transportation websites (National Express, FlixBus, Megabus), our current single-page design lacks commercial-grade structure, modern UX patterns, and comprehensive content architecture required for a professional transportation company.

---

## 1. CURRENT DESIGN GAPS (Critical Issues)

### 1.1 Structural Problems
- **Single Page Design**: We have only a homepage; competitors have 8-12 pages
- **No Service Pages**: Missing dedicated pages for each service type
- **No Booking System**: Competitors prioritize journey booking as primary CTA
- **Limited Navigation**: Header lacks comprehensive service navigation
- **No Trust Indicators**: Missing safety certifications, testimonials, guarantees

### 1.2 UX/UI Gaps Identified
- **Booking Interface**: Competitors feature prominent "Choose your journey" booking forms
- **Service Categories**: No clear service differentiation (corporate, school, wedding, etc.)
- **Content Depth**: Competitors have detailed service pages with specifications
- **Mobile Experience**: Our current design needs mobile-first optimization
- **Interactive Elements**: Missing dynamic booking forms, calculators, quote systems

### 1.3 Brand Positioning Issues
- **Professional Authority**: Competitors emphasize experience, safety, reliability
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Our hero doesn't clearly communicate primary services
- **Call-to-Action Flow**: No clear user journey from landing to booking/contact
